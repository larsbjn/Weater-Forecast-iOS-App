# Weater Forecast iOS App - SDU - iOS Course 2021

## App Idea
A weather application where the user is able to enter a city they want to see the weather for. This list is saved on the device, and is displayed to the user so they can easy select a city. The application will contain three different screens: The list of saved cities, the weather forecast for next couple of days for the selected city, and a more detailed description of the weather in a city on a specific date. Web calls will be used to fetch the weather data from the selected city. If there is time for it, it would be nice to implement a GPS location-based city, so the user is able to see the weather for their current city, without having to manually search for it.
